# 🔐 Password Manager – C# OOP Project

A secure, role-based password management system built with **C#**, **MySQL**, and **AES encryption**.

This application allows users to create accounts, log in, and manage their password vaults. Features include encrypted password storage, password filtering, strong password generation, and role-based permissions (Admin vs Standard users).

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **AES Encryption** of all user credentials using BouncyCastle  
- 👥 **Role-based Access Control**: Admin and Standard users  
- 🧾 **User Account Management**: Sign up and log in securely  
- 📁 **Add / View / Delete Credentials**  
- 🔎 **Filter Passwords by Category**  
- 🔄 **Strong Password Generator**  
- 🗄️ **Persistent Storage** with MySQL backend  
- 🧠 **Object-Oriented Design**

---

## 🧠 OOP Principles

- **Abstraction**: Base `User` class defines shared behavior for `AdminUser` and `StandardUser`
- **Encapsulation**: Sensitive data and encryption logic contained within dedicated methods
- **Inheritance**: Role-specific behavior implemented via class hierarchy
- **Polymorphism**: Shared interfaces and overridden methods for flexible behavior

## 🧩 Key Classes

| Class                  | Responsibility                                                  |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `User.cs`              | Abstract base class with shared user methods                    |
| `AdminUser.cs`         | Inherits from `User`, can add/view/delete credentials           |
| `StandardUser.cs`      | Inherits from `User`, can add/view credentials                  |
| `Credentials.cs`       | Stores individual credentials with encrypted password storage   |
| `Encryption.cs`        | Implements `IEncryptable` interface using AES encryption        |
| `PasswordVault.cs`     | Stores a user’s credentials and handles DB interaction          |
| `UserDBManager.cs`     | Handles MySQL user operations: login, signup, validation        |
| `CredentialsDBManager.cs` | Handles MySQL credential operations: CRUD operations       |
| `PasswordGenerator.cs` | Generates secure random passwords                               |
| `Program.cs`           | Manages overall program flow and user interaction               |

## 🧱 Design Patterns

- 🏭 **Factory Pattern**: Used in `ValidateUser()` to instantiate user types based on access level  
- 🧠 **Strategy Pattern**: Encryption logic abstracted via `IEncryptable` interface  
- 🧰 **Façade Pattern**: `PasswordVault` class simplifies access to credential management and DB operations

---

## 📈 Enhancements 

- Integrated **MySQL** database for persistent user and credential storage
- Applied **AES encryption** for secure password handling
- Implemented **strong password generator** for enhanced user security
- Added **filtering functionality** for better user experience
- Structured program for **modularity and scalability** using OOP and design patterns
